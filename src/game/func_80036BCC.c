/* D_801D9174: a lookup table of 0x1E-byte records, each prefixed by a
   big-endian u16 id (id field for record i lives 2 bytes apart, but the
   record itself is 0x1E bytes -- id and record strides differ, so this is
   NOT `struct { u16 id; ... } records[]`; it is a compact id table walked
   in lockstep with the 0x1E-byte record table). Terminated by an id of 0.
   Returns a pointer to the matching record, or NULL if not found / list
   ends first. */
