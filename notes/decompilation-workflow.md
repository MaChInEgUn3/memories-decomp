# Matching Decompilation Workflow

## Match invariant

After the assembly baseline, every accepted source change must preserve:

```sh
make match
```

The entire rebuilt `SLUS_014.11` must retain the target SHA-256. A function is
not matching merely because it is functionally equivalent or has a similar
instruction count.

## Function conversion

For each candidate:

1. Select a small function with a stable boundary and understood callers,
   globals, and data references.
2. Record any naming or type evidence under `notes/`.
3. Move the function into an appropriate C translation unit under `src/`.
4. Keep an exact assembly fallback until the C object matches.
5. Compare instructions, relocations, section placement, and read-only data.
6. Adjust source structure or measured compiler flags without changing
   behavior.
7. Run the full executable match.
8. Update generated progress metadata.
9. Commit only that function or an inseparable tightly coupled group.

The tracked inventory is `config/slus_01411/functions.csv`. Reconcile generated
boundaries and ownership before selecting work:

```sh
make classify-functions
make progress
```

The inventory records address, size, current name, status, module ownership,
and durable notes. Its address and size fields must continue to agree with the
generated split.

## Function status classes

- **Matching C:** compiler-generated game code reproduced from tracked C.
- **Unmatched assembly:** exact fallback that still requires decompilation.
- **Handwritten assembly:** code whose instruction patterns indicate assembly
  was the likely original source model.
- **SDK/library assembly:** identified PsyQ or runtime code retained or replaced
  according to the selected library strategy.
- **Embedded text data:** bytes inside the resident text range that are not part
  of a function.
- **Classified binary data:** mapped non-code regions that do not count toward
  C progress.

Splat's `Handwritten function` classification is an initial heuristic. It must
be corroborated before being treated as final.

## Naming

- Use address-based names such as `func_80012345` and `D_80012345` until there
  is concrete semantic evidence.
- Preserve addresses in notes when renaming symbols.
- Prefer names supported by strings, call relationships, SDK signatures,
  repeated structure accesses, or observed behavior.
- Do not assign speculative subsystem or gameplay names merely to reduce the
  unknown-symbol count.

## Types

- Use fixed-width PSX types and do not rely on the host ABI.
- Recover shared structures from repeated offsets before duplicating local
  placeholder structs.
- Keep pointer/integer conversions explicit and compatible with the 32-bit PSX
  address model.
- Record uncertain fields and competing interpretations in notes rather than
  hiding them with unsafe casts.

## Compiler experiments

- Keep probe sources, generated objects, and diffs under `tmp/`.
- Record durable compiler/version/flag conclusions in `notes/toolchain.md`.
- Require multiple independent matching samples before selecting a compiler.
- Do not infer the compiler solely from the North American release year.
- Do not download or commit proprietary PsyQ binaries. Any user-supplied
  candidate remains ignored under `tools/toolchains/`.

## Commit discipline

- Copilot is the sole author and committer.
- Do not add a `Co-authored-by` trailer.
- Make one validated logical change per commit.
- Prefer one matched function per commit.
- Keep tool, map, linker, source, and documentation-only changes separate when
  they are independently valid.
- Never amend or rewrite completed commits unless the user explicitly requests
  it.
