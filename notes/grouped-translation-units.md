# Grouped Translation Units

## Contract

`config/slus_01411/matching_c.json` continues to record one row per matched
function, but multiple rows may now share one C source when all of these
conditions hold:

1. The functions are contiguous in executable address order.
2. Every member uses the same compiler profile.
3. The source defines every member in that same order.
4. The sum of the member sizes exactly covers the C subsegment.
5. A clean full build remains byte-identical to `game/SLUS_014.11`.

`tools/project/generate_build_config.py` enforces the first four conditions and
emits one `text_sources.json` object with a `members` list. The full executable
match enforces the fifth.

Single-function refinement integration refuses to replace one member of a
grouped source. Semantic renaming may update symbols inside a grouped source,
but it does not automatically rename a source file owned by multiple
functions.

Historical external-candidate hashes remain provenance for the source tested
at integration time. The repository audit checks that the current pure-C
translation unit defines the expected symbol with the accepted profile; the
full executable hash remains the authority after later semantic renames or
source grouping.

## Initial groups

| Translation unit | Profile | Members |
|---|---|---|
| `src/game/duel_card_checks.c` | `gcc_2_8_1_g0_split` | `Duel_CheckEquip` (`0x80019A08`), `Duel_CheckFusion` (`0x80019A60`) |
| `src/game/duel_battle_stats.c` | `gcc_2_8_1_g8` | `Duel_CalcBattleAttack` (`0x8001EF1C`), `Duel_CalcBattleDefense` (`0x8001EF78`) |
| `src/game/ai_fusion.c` | `gcc_2_8_1_g0_split` | `AiScript_FindEquipTarget` (`0x8007249C`) through `Ai_CompleteFusion` (`0x800727C0`) |
| `src/game/ai_script_vm.c` | `gcc_2_8_1_g0_split` | `AiScript_Init` (`0x800705D8`), `AiScript_Run` (`0x80070650`) |
| `src/game/ai_set_queries.c` | `gcc_2_8_1_g0_split` | `Ai_IsCardInSet` (`0x80070870`), `Ai_IsTypeInSet` (`0x800708C4`) |
| `src/game/ai_script_card_info.c` | `gcc_2_8_1_g0_split` | `AiScript_TestHighStat` (`0x80071194`) through `AiScript_LoadCardID` (`0x800712B4`) |

These pilots reduce four one-function source files to two coherent
translation units and reduce generated C objects from 769 to 767. Function
emission order and the complete retail executable SHA-256 remain unchanged.

## Expansion policy

Expand grouping only after names and behavior are stable. Prefer small
subsystem runs with shared declarations. Do not bridge an assembly function,
mix compiler profiles, reorder functions, or merge a function whose remaining
inline assembly would make later refinement unsafe.
